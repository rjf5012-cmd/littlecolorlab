            Little Color Lab is dedicated to creating kid-safe, classroom-friendly printable coloring pages
            for teachers, parents, and young artists. This page explains how we plan, review, and approve
            coloring sheets before they appear on our site.

        <h2>Our Commitment to Quality &amp; Safety</h2>
        <p>
          Little Color Lab is designed to be a trusted resource for teachers, homeschool families,
          and parents looking for simple, printable coloring pages. We focus on clean black-and-white
          line art with bold outlines, clear shapes, and age-appropriate themes for preschool,
          kindergarten, and elementary-aged children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every coloring page on Little Color Lab is reviewed to make sure it is appropriate, safe,
          and easy to use in classrooms, therapy settings, and at home.
        </p>

        <h2>How Our Coloring Pages Are Created</h2>
        <p>
          Our coloring pages are created using a mix of original artwork, digital illustration tools,
          and carefully reviewed AI-assisted sketches. When AI is used in the creative process, every
          single design is manually checked and edited before it goes live.
        </p>
        <p>
          During review, we look for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bold, clean outlines that print clearly on standard letter-sized paper</li>
          <li>Simple shapes that are easy for small hands to color</li>
          <li>Balanced designs without overly dense or confusing details</li>
          <li>Consistent line style across each collection or theme</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Age-Appropriate Themes &amp; Content</h2>
        <p>
          Little Color Lab focuses on positive, kid-friendly themes such as holidays, animals, space,
          sports, and simple doodle-style scenes. We do not publish content that includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Graphic or realistic violence</li>
          <li>Scary, disturbing, or horror imagery</li>
          <li>Weapons or unsafe behavior</li>
          <li>Mature, suggestive, or adult themes</li>
          <li>Political messaging or persuasion</li>
          <li>Religious persuasion or doctrinal material</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our goal is to keep Little Color Lab suitable for children ages 3–10 and safe for use in
          early education environments.
        </p>

        <h2>Originality, Copyright &amp; Trademarks</h2>
        <p>
          We respect copyright and intellectual property rights. Little Color Lab does not intentionally
          use licensed characters, celebrity likenesses, or trademarked logos. We avoid recreating or
          closely copying designs from existing commercial coloring books, movies, or brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, we focus on generic, original, and public-domain friendly subjects such as dinosaurs,
          animals, shapes, rockets, sports, and holiday icons like pumpkins, snowmen, or shamrocks.
        </p>

        <h2>Safety &amp; Quality Review Process</h2>
        <p>
          Before a new coloring page is added to the site, it goes through a multi-step review process:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Content Safety Review</strong> – We confirm that the image is age-appropriate and free from sensitive or inappropriate content.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality Check</strong> – We make sure the line weight is consistent, the design is printable, and no key details are accidentally cut off.</li>
          <li><strong>Theme &amp; Labeling Check</strong> – We verify that the title, tags, and category (for example, “Valentine's Day” or “St. Patrick's Day”) match the design.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Check</strong> – We confirm that the PDF and preview image are linked correctly and that the file size is reasonable for quick classroom printing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>No Low-Quality or Spam Content</h2>
        <p>
          We do not publish mass-generated or low-quality “filler” images. Each design must meet our
          standards for clarity, print quality, and kid-friendliness before being included in a category
          or featured on the homepage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also do not accept unreviewed user uploads or third-party image submissions. All pages on
          Little Color Lab are curated and approved by an editor.
        </p>

        <h2>Updates, Fixes &amp; Removals</h2>
        <p>
          If you spot an issue with any coloring page—such as a broken link, a mislabelled theme,
          or a design that you feel is not appropriate—we want to know about it. We review reported
          issues as quickly as possible and update or remove content where necessary.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>Affiliate Links &amp; Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          Little Color Lab may include affiliate links to coloring supplies such as crayons, markers,
          or colored pencils. As an Amazon Associate, Little Color Lab earns from qualifying purchases.
          These commissions help support the site and keep the coloring pages free to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Affiliate links and advertisements do not change how we create or review coloring pages.
          We only recommend products that are appropriate for children and commonly used in homes
          and classrooms.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Promise to Teachers &amp; Parents</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to keeping Little Color Lab:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kid-safe</strong> – No inappropriate themes or hidden surprises</li>
          <li><strong>Teacher-friendly</strong> – Easy-to-print PDFs and classroom-ready designs</li>
          <li><strong>Free to use</strong> – The core coloring pages remain free for educators and families</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent</strong> – Clear disclosures about affiliate links and ads</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have suggestions for new themes, categories, or improvements to our editorial standards,
          we’d love to hear from you. Little Color Lab will continue to grow with feedback from the
          teachers and parents who use it every day.
